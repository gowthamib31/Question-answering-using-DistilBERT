Question answering using DistilBERT is  NLP project that utilizes distilbert model for answering questions in effective way .


This project aims to build a smart system that answers questions using Distil-BERT, a faster version of BERT. A question answering system using Distil-BERT, a variant of the BERT model optimized for efficiency. The system will be trained to understand and answer questions based on given contexts. The project involves several key steps, including setting up the development environment, obtaining and pre-processing a suitable dataset for question answering, fine-tuning the Distil-BERT model on the dataset, training the model, evaluating its performance. The training phase involves iterative adjustments to optimize the model's performance, leveraging the inherent capabilities of Distil-BERT to comprehend and process complex linguistic structures. Evaluation forms a crucial component of the project, where the system's proficiency in answering questions is rigorously assessed, ensuring its efficacy across a diverse array of queries. By leveraging the power of Distil-BERT and carefully crafting the training process, the goal is to create an effective question answering system that can provide accurate answers to a wide range of questions.

# MODULES

•	TRAINING PHASE: Initially, the DistilBERT model is trained on a large dataset containing pairs of questions and their corresponding answers. During training, the model learns to understand the context of the text and how to generate appropriate responses to questions based on this understanding. This process involves adjusting the model's internal parameters to minimize errors and improve performance.
•	FINE-TUNING: After pre-training, the DistilBERT model is fine-tuned specifically for the task of Question Answering. This involves further adjusting the model's parameters using a smaller dataset containing examples of questions and their correct answers. Fine-tuning allows the model to specialize in answering questions more accurately.
•	INFERENCE PHASE: Once the model is trained and fine-tuned, it can be used to answer questions in real-time. During the inference phase, the model takes input in the form of a question and a passage of text relevant to the question. It then processes this input using its learned knowledge to generate a concise and accurate answer.
•	EVALUATION: Finally, the performance of the DistilBERT-based Question Answering system is evaluated.
